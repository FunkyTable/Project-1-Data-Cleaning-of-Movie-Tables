# Project 1 - Launching XBoxOffice 

## Overview
1. This is GitHub repository represents the final project submission for Greg Osborne's first project at FlatIron school. The project assignment was to analyze a selected set of data for box office data and to create a presentation to present to a Microsoft executive that summarizes the results.
## Business Understanding
1. Microsoft’s strong representation in the fields of personal computing, business computing, and interactive entertainment needs to expand into other forms of popular media to stay competitive and attract new customers. Microsoft wishes to investigate the best way to expand into the blockbuster movie industry. Microsoft faces competition from the five titans of the film industry
2. Based on these instructions, I developed the following business questions:
      * What genres of film produce the highest box office revenue?
      * What is the best month to release a film to generate the most revenue?
      * What writers, directors, producers, actors and actresses have the highest revenue earning potential?
## Data Understanding and Analysis
1. Source of data
      * All data used in this project was provided for me by FlatIron Schoo. It includes data from IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo, The Numbers, and The Movie Database. However, I did not use data from each of these organizations. I primarily relied on IMDB and The Numbers for my data.
2. Description of data
    * From IMDB I gleaned personnel that created the films analyzed, genre, and other basic film information. From The Numbers I gleaned the release date and box office performance. Those were the primary data points and metrics I used in my analysis. 
3. Three visualizations (the same visualizations presented in the slides and notebook)

## Conclusion
1. This analysis is limited by time and budget. There are many other factors to consider when trying to launch a film business. Some areas to consider looking into before producing a film are:
    * How much do existing franchises influence the public’s film choices?
    * If existing film franchises have a lot of draw, does the public have the appetite for more after they’ve already spent a lot of time and money on the existing franchises?
    * Should Microsoft find a existing property and option it for film or start new?
    * Is streaming a better option for building the brand and generating revenue?
    * Should Microsoft purchase one of the big studios instead of entering the competition?
    * Rather than make a specific recommendation for which film to greenlight, I want to strongly recommend more research. 
    * Three conclusions I do have:
        1. The public likes action and adventure films. 
        2. The best release windows are May-July and November-December.
        3. Writers and actors are the best creative personnel to increase a films revenue potential.
    * I think more time spent in answering the questions in the slide above would go a long way in helping Microsoft be successful with their film aspirations.
